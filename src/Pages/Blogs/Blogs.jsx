              Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which
              enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given
              domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy
              (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain
              attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and
              implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks
              such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).The role of a CORS
              policy is to maintain the integrity of a website and secure it
              from unauthorized access. The CORS protocol was defined to relax
              the default security policy called the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)
              used by the browsers to protect their resources. The Same-Origin
              Policy permits the browser to load resources only from a server
              hosted in the same-origin as the browser. The SOP was defined in
              the early years of the web and turned out to be too restrictive
              for the new age applications where we often need to fetch
              different kinds of resources from multiple origins. The CORS
              protocol is implemented by all modern browsers to allow controlled
              access to resources located outside of the browserâ€™s origin.

              The private route component is similar to the public route, the
              only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If
              the user is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login
              page and the user can only access the authenticated routes If he
              is authenticated (Logged in).

              Node.js accepts the request from the clients and sends the
              response, while working with the request node.js handles them with
              a single thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use
              the concept of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that
              the server needs to perform. It runs parallel on the server to
              provide the information to multiple clients. Node.js is an event
              loop single-threaded language. It can handle concurrent requests
              with a single thread without blocking it for one request.
